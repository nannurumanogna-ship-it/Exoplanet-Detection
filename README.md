# Exoplanet Detection Project

## Description
This project aims to detect exoplanets from astronomical data. It utilizes machine learning models to classify stars as either having an exoplanet or not, based on their flux variations over time. The project involves data loading, preprocessing (including handling class imbalance with SMOTE), normalization, and training various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The performance of these models is evaluated using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
